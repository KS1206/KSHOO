A 
</font>
<font face=Impact><b><big>shepherd</b></big></font>
boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields <br>
<font face=Times New Roman>
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</font>
</p>


<p>
<font face=Times New Roman>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying <br>
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but <br>
didn't find any wolf.<br>
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font face=Times New Roman>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". 
</font>
<font face=Impact><b><big>The boy </b></big></font><br>
<font face=Impact><b><big>played a similar trick repeatedly for many days. </b></big></font><br>
</p>

After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, <br>
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. <br>
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a </strike><br>
<strike>lamb away!"</strike>
</font>
</p>


<p>
<font face=Times New Roman color=purple>
<big>The farmers <sub>thought</sub> the boy was playing <sup>mischief</sup> again.</big> </font>
<font face=Times New Roman>
So, no one paid <br>
attention to him and didn't come to his help. <br>
